            <h2>Sri Lanka</h2>
            <p>
               Sri Lanka is the neighbor of India, a multinational state, lies
               in the ocean and is known for its interesting culture and food.
               It also has great sights for tourists. The landscape of Sri Lanka
               is especially known because it has wildlife that consist of
               buffalos, elephants and sloth bears. Sri Lanka has great beaches
               to go surfing. With over 1000 kilometers of coastline adorned
               with beautiful beaches, a holiday in Sri Lanka is also perfect
               for beach lovers.

            <h2>Paris</h2>

            <p>
               On holiday in Paris, with so many sights, it is difficult to
               choose what to do first. Discover the romance of the French city
               on the river Seine, admire the famous works of art in one of the
               many museums in Paris, or go for a day of luxury shopping? And of
               course, the most visited monument in France and the symbol of
               Paris, the Eiffel Tower, should not be missed. If you book a
               centrally located 4 star hotel from TUI, you will be happy: the
               Eiffel Tower.

            <p>
               In the south of Europe, a diverse country awaits your arrival
               where several holiday wishes can be combined. Beach, sea, nature
               and culture. Everything is there during a holiday in Greece. And
               then we haven't even mentioned the many hours of sunshine and the
               proverbial hospitality. Choose a holiday to the Greek islands, a
               city trip in Athens or plan a tour through Greece. As soon as you
               smell the scent of pine trees and the warm air hangs around you,
               you will catch the Greek holiday feeling!

            <h2>Mauritius</h2>
            <p>
               If you like to combine a beach holiday with trips in breathtaking
               nature, choose a holiday to Mauritius. Book cheap flights with
               TUI and travel to this beautiful bounty island located
               approximately 850 kilometers east of Madagascar. The snow-white
               beaches of Mauritius on the Indian Ocean are not only popular
               with sunbathers, but also with divers. The seaside resort of Trou
               Aux Biches is located on the popular north coast of Mauritius,
               which is mainly characterized by the many shipwrecks that lie off
               the coast.

            <h2>Rome</h2>
            <p>
               All roads lead to Rome. Will you join us in this Eternal City,
               where the present and the many monuments and buildings of the
               past meet? Rome is also seen as one large open-air museum in
               which you go back to Roman times. The tightly ordered pattern of
               the Romans, the exuberant splendor of the Middle Ages and the
               Renaissance and the wonderful Italian mentality of today: Rome
               has it all!

            <h2>Montenegro</h2>
            <p>
               Majestic mountains and breathtakingly beautiful beaches with deep
               blue bays, that is Montenegro. But Montenegro is much more. This
               country in the Balkans may be fairly small, but in terms of
               beauty, beaches and the amount of sights it is certainly not
               inferior to popular holiday countries such as Italy. The climate
               of Montenegro is also very pleasant: the average temperature in
               summer is around 26 degrees or above, ideal for a beach holiday
               on the Adriatic coast.
